# Linux

Linux is the operating system of the developers, webservers and super computers. The top 500 supercomputers use linux as their operating system.

Linux operating systems are software distributions (also known as distros) which has linux kernel underneath the operating system.

A distribution a collection of programs  so organised to function as an operating system. It will also have its own package manager where you can upgrade and add and remove programs from a software repository.  These different programs existing as independent projects else where on the internet  will work together to act as a coherent single system.

There are various distros and family of distros.  

The major distros are
- debian (somehow i consider debian to be good for my work)
- Ubuntu
- Linuxmint
- Red hat 
- CentOS
- Open suse


Ubuntu is derived from Debian and some distros like linux mint are derived from ubuntu . Hence debian can also be considered as headfigure of a family of distros.
